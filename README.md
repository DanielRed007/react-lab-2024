# React Lab 2024

A workshop to study technical features about ReactJS and related technologies.

## Why?

- I want to implement features from ReactJS, improving my experience in all of its new tools and Frameworks.
- I want to implement web application with a heavy emphasis in Testing every feature i produce, even if It's just for learning purposes.
- I want to go deeper in knowledge about the latets React Framework and tools.
- I want to have fun doing structured stuff and be a much better software developer.

## Description

- It consist in a series of frontend prototype projects, each of them is a separate ecosystem from each other.
- The intention is to test as many features as i can from an specific tech stack trying to implement test functionality.
- Every commit to the main branch MUST have its corresponding tests. According to the developed functionality.

## Tech Stack

- ReactJS
- Typescript
- NextJS
- RemixJS
- React Testing Library
- Tailwind UI
- Redux Toolkit
- Redux Devtools

## Installation

Clone the repo, inside You will find a series of labs just pick anyone you wish to check and run

```bash
  npm install <any lab>
```

Once inside the repo, run the test:

```bash
  npm run test
```

# Laboratories

## Lab 01

Lab 01 was built to implement new functionalities and features using NextJS and Tailwind UI, works as a Webpage the has many routes trying to leverage as much NextJS + ReactJS features as possible, also all the functionality has its corresponding Unit Tests.

### Notes:

- Redux/toolkit was added under the NextJS Strategy for the App routing methodology for such framework.
- It works using Redux Devtools in Chromium and/or supported browsers for the corresponding extension.

## Lab 02

Lab 02 has the intention to explore Headless UI, the Tailwind library, and use the NextJS legacy routing strategy, because my current projects require a deeper understnadig, so this is a warming up. Also I'm using ReactJS Context API, and React Testing Library to all of my components.

### Notes:

- ReactJS Context API.
- Headless UI (Tailwind CSS/UI).
- React Testing Library
